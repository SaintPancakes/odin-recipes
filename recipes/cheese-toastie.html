        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the filling.</strong> Mix the yoghurt with the chives or spring onion. Stir in the grated cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the bread.</strong> Place the bread slices on a chopping board, buttered-side down. Spread one with chutney and top the other with the cheese filling. Lay the ham and cornichon on top, if using. Put the chutney-spread piece of bread on top of the cheesy piece, buttered-side up.</li>
            <li><strong>Fry the sandwhich.</strong> Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Put the sandwich in the pan and fry for 3 minutes on one side, pressing down lightly with a spatula every so often, or until the bread is golden brown. Carefully turn over, using your spatula and another flattish implement, such as a palette knife or the back of a wooden spoon. Fry for a further 2 minutes or until crisp and golden.</li>
            <li><strong>All done!</strong> Cut the sandwich in half and serve with a green salad.</li>
